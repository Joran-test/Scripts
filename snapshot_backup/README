snapshot_backup.sh is a Bash implementation for a snapshot backup.

Before starting, copy config_sample.sh to config/my_backup.sh and edit it:
# cp config_sample.sh config/my_backup.sh
# vim config/my_backup.sh
The parameters there are fairly straight forward.

How does it work?
 - On the first run, snapshot_backup.sh will simply rsync your source
   directory to the destination directory, creating daily.1.
 - On the second run, snapshot_backup.sh will:
   - Rename daily.1 into daily.2
   - Hardlink daily.2 into daily.1
   - Run rsync to synchronize your current source directory with daily.1
     replacing only files that have changed
 - Third run and on would look like the second run, rotating the directories
   from daily.x into daily.x+1 and an rsync from the source directory to the
   destination directory.
 - If you had SNAPSHOT_NR set into 7, and have daily.7 in your backup
   destination directory, then the following would happen:
   - Rename daily.7 into something temporary, call it "giraffe"
   - Rename daily.x into daily.x+1
   - Rename "giraffe" into daily.1
   - Synchronize with rsync daily.1
   That way we never have the tedious task of removing a backup directory - a
   task that can take quite long...
   What we actually do here is 'recycle' the last backup.
