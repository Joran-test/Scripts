shk - Simple Hardening Kit
shk is intended to be used in order to easily secure and harden your system.
In the plugins/ directory you'll find plugins you can easily add in order to
further customize shk.

shk should work on most Debian and most Redhats, although I must admit that
some of the debian capabilities I didn't fully checked.

Invokation can be done by:
 # ./shk.sh
Invoking a single plugin:
 # ./shk.sh plugins/firewall.sh

Please edit config.sh before invoking anything and edit it accordingly.
